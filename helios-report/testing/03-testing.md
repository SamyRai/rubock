# Testing: Strong Patterns Undermined by Critical Gaps

The project has a solid foundation for testing, leveraging table-driven tests, the `testify` assertion library, and effective mocking for dependencies. However, the current test suites have critical gaps that fail to detect major architectural flaws, particularly in the worker services.

## Strengths

-   **Effective Use of Mocks:** The `api` and `build-worker` tests demonstrate an excellent mocking strategy. The `NatsPublisher` interface allows for a clean, testable separation of concerns.

    **Code Evidence (`services/api/internal/handlers/handlers_test.go`):**
    ```go
    // MockNatsPublisher is a mock implementation of the NatsPublisher interface
    type MockNatsPublisher struct {
        PublishedSubject string
        PublishedData    []byte
        PublishError     error
    }

    // Publish records the subject and data it was called with...
    func (m *MockNatsPublisher) Publish(subject string, data []byte) error {
        m.PublishedSubject = subject
        m.PublishedData = data
        return m.PublishError
    }
    ```
    This mock allows tests to assert that a publish was *attempted* even if it failed, which is a crucial detail for verifying side effects.

-   **Table-Driven Tests:** The use of table-driven tests (e.g., in `TestCreateApplicationHandler`) provides excellent organization and case coverage, testing success paths, invalid input, and downstream failures.

## Critical Weaknesses

### 1. Tests Fail to Detect Missing Message Acknowledgements

This is the most significant testing gap. The worker tests pass a `*nats.Msg` to the handler but have no way to verify that the message was acknowledged. This means the test suites give a false sense of security while a critical bug goes undetected.

**Code Evidence (`services/build-worker/internal/worker/worker_test.go`):**
```go
func TestHandleDeploymentRequest(t *testing.T) {
    // ...
    for _, tc := range testCases {
        t.Run(tc.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // ...
            msg := &nats.Msg{
                Subject: events.SubjectDeploymentRequested,
                Data:    tc.natsMsgData,
            }

            // Execute
            worker.HandleDeploymentRequest(msg)

            // Assert
            // ... a bunch of assertions ...
            // NO ASSERTION for m.Ack() is possible here.
        })
    }
}
```
-   **Impact:** The tests pass, but the underlying code is broken in a way that will cause major reliability issues (infinite message redelivery). The test setup itself is flawed because it doesn't provide a way to monitor for acknowledgements.

### 2. Inconsistent Test Quality

The quality of tests is inconsistent across services. The `oal-worker` tests are particularly weak.

**Code Evidence (`services/oal-worker/internal/worker/worker_test.go`):**
```go
func TestHandleBuildSucceeded(t *testing.T) {
    // ...
    for _, tc := range testCases {
        // ...
        // Execute & Assert
        // The handler should be robust and not panic...
        require.NotPanics(t, func() {
            worker.HandleBuildSucceeded(msg)
        }, "HandleBuildSucceeded should not panic")
    }
}
```
-   **Impact:** This test only verifies that the handler doesn't panic. It doesn't assert any behavior, log output, or side effects, making it largely ineffective. It provides almost no confidence that the worker is functioning correctly.

### 3. Missing Integration and End-to-End (E2E) Tests

The repository contains only unit tests. There are no tests that verify the interactions *between* services.
-   **Impact:** It's impossible to know if the system works as a whole. For example:
    -   Does the `build-worker` correctly consume and process the `DeploymentRequest` event published by the `api` service?
    -   Does the `oal-worker` correctly consume the `BuildSucceeded` event from the `build-worker`?
    Without integration tests, these critical workflows are completely untested.

### 4. No Test Coverage Reporting

The `make test` command runs all tests but does not generate a coverage report.
-   **Impact:** It is difficult to know which parts of the code are not covered by tests. This makes it hard to identify testing gaps and can lead to a false sense of security. Integrating `go tool cover` into the CI pipeline is essential.
